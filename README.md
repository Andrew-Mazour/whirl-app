## Whirl

Whirl is a private social media app where the admin controls who can join. Unlike traditional social networks, Whirl ensures that you only interact with your chosen friends, making it a more secure and intimate platform. Users can post, like, comment, and engage in typical social media interactions without the noise of public platforms.
